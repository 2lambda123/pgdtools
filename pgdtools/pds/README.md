# PGD Tools - PDS

This folder provides tools to turn the presolar grain database
into a PDS compatible format.
The following tools are available:

## `bibparser.py`: Parse the bibliography

This script will parse the bibliography and create a OLAF copy/paste-able textfile.
See docs inside the script for an explanation on what it does.

## `olaf.py`: Create dataset to import into OLAF

This script will create a dataset that can be imported into OLAF.
This is a preparation step in order to get the whole data set into the PDS format.
See docs inside the script for an explanation on what it does / how it works.
